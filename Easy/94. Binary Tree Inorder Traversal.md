> Given the ```root``` of a binary tree, return the inorder traversal of its nodes' values.

#### Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/inorder_1.jpg)
```python
Input: root = [1, null, 2, 3]
Output: [1, 3, 2]
```

#### Example 2:
```python
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

#### Example 3:
```python
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]

#### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range ```[0, 100]```.
- ```-100 <= Node.val <= 100```
